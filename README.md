# A website for my 1969 Volkswagen Bus 

I purchased Donna aka The Champ in 2004 and for many years she was my faithful daily driver. 

When my wife joined the US Navy I had to put her into storage. That was in 2013. In 2019 I was finally able to bring her out of storage and back home. 

It is with deep sadness that I have decided to let Donna move onto a new home. My family is getting ready to move again and bringing Donna with us would be quite difficult and expensive. We are moving to Connecticut and that is not an ideal environment for a classic vehicle. We have purchased a home as well and so I have come to realize that financially we will not be able to commit to the necessary repairs to keep Donna on the road for several years.

I do not want to bring her with us just to watch her slowly rust away, a home for weeds, spiders, and mice nests while I wait for funding to repair and restore her to her former glory. 

I spent the summer living out of Donna while interning as a rock climbing guide in California's majestic Sierra Nevada. She was waiting for me when I came home from fighting the war on terror in Afghanistan. My wife and I have taken her on some awesome adventures. She is a part of the family. Therefore I am firm on the price, and will not let her go to just anyone. 

I will also require you to sign a first right of refusal if you should ever want to sell her after purchasing her from me. You will have to ask me first if I want to buy.
