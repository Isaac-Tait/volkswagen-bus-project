# A website for my 1969 Volkswagen Bus 

I purchased Donna aka The Champ in 2004 and for many years she was my faithful daily driver. 

When my wife joined the US Navy I had to put her into storage. That was in 2013. In 2019 I was finally able to bring her out of storage and back home. 

It is with deep sadness that I have decided to let Donna move onto a new home. My family is getting ready to move again and brining Donna with us would be quite difficult and expensive. We are moving to Connecticut and that is not an ideal environment for a classic vehicle. We have purchased a home as well and so I have come to realize that financially we will not be able to commit to the necessary repairs to keep Donna on the road.

I do not want to bring her with us just to watch her slowly rust away waiting for funding to repair and restore her to her former glory.
