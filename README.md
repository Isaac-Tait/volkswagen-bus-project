# A website for my 1969 Volkswagen Bus 

I purchased Donna aka The Champ in 2004 and for many years she was my faithful daily driver. 

When my wife joined the US Navy I had to put her into storage. That was in 2013. In 2019 I was finally able to bring her out of storage and back home. 

It is with deep sadness that I have decided that it is best to let Donna move onto a new home. My family is getting ready to move again and bringing Donna with us would be quite difficult and expensive. We are moving and have purchased a home. So, I have come to realize that financially we will not be able to commit to the necessary repairs to keep Donna on the road for several years.

I do not want to bring her with us just to watch her slowly rust away; a home for weeds, spiders, and mice nests while I scrape together funding to repair and restore her to her former glory. 

When I was younger I spent a wonderful and glorious summer living the "van-life" while I traveled the great American West as a rock climbing guide in California's majestic Sierra Nevada and Utah's incomparable Wasatch Mountains. Donna was waiting for me when I came home from fighting the war on terror in Afghanistan. My wife and I have taken her on some awesome adventures. She is a part of the family. Therefore I am firm on the price, and will not let her go to just anyone. 

I will also require you to sign an agreement granting me first right of refusal if you should decide to sell her down the road.
